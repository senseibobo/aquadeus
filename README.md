# Aquadeus 
This is another game that I made with people I had previously not known. It won 2nd place on the OpenIT Game Jam 2022.<br>
It's a 2-player game about Poseidon and Neptune fighting about who the real god of the sea is.<br>
It's designed for controllers primarily, but also supports keyboard.<br>
Features:
- Melee and ranged attacks
- Random swordfish that spawn occasionally which you can pick up
- Throw the fish to use it as an attack
- Eat the fish to heal
- 3 rounds
- Moses event, indicated by "Mojsije incoming" text
- Cool jumping manouvers with melee attacks
